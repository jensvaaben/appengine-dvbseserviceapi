You need http://www.dvbstreamexplorer.com/dvbse/dvbse.php to acquire DVB service data and save it to XML file.
You need https://dvbseserviceproc.codeplex.com/ to send data encoded in JSON to a web-service.
This project is the source code for a minimal service running on Google App Engine.
A live version of web-service can be found here: http://dvbseserviceapi.appspot.com
NOTE: This application does not in itself do anything productive/useful. Instead it's meant as starting point for creating an application that can consume DVBStreamExplorer service information.
